      <h1>Obesity Epidemic in Taiwan</h1>
      <p>
        Taiwan has seen a significant rise in obesity rates in recent years.
        According to the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare, the obesity rate
        among adults increased from 28.7% in 2017 to 31.8% in 2021. A major
        factor contributing to this rise is the increased consumption of
        high-calorie, sugar-laden beverages like bubble tea. Obesity is a major
        risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes, and with more people turning
        to sugary drinks like bubble tea daily, the trend is becoming
        concerning.

      <h1>Diabetes Prevalence in Taiwan</h1>
      <p>
        Type 2 diabetes is also on the rise in Taiwan. In 2020, the Taiwan
        Diabetes Association reported that 11% of the population over the age of
        18 had diabetes, with an additional 20% being pre-diabetic. This is
        higher than the global average, and excessive sugar consumption, along
        with a lack of physical activity, plays a major role. Bubble tea’s high
        sugar content contributes to insulin resistance, a precursor to
        diabetes, with nearly 2 million people in Taiwan currently living with
        the condition.

    <h1>Bubble Tea and the Rise of "Sugar Addiction"</h1>
    <p>
      Bubble Tea and the Rise of "Sugar Addiction" Some studies have even
      likened the over-consumption of sugary drinks to addiction, often
      referring to it as “sugar addiction.” The sugar in bubble tea, especially
      when consumed regularly, stimulates the brain's reward system in a way
      similar to addictive substances, creating a cycle of cravings and
      consumption. For many people, the sweet taste of bubble tea becomes hard
      to resist, leading them to consume it more frequently than they might
      intend. Moreover, sugar intake from drinks like bubble tea does not
      provide the same sense of fullness as food, which can lead to overeating
      or snacking on unhealthy foods later. This “empty calorie” nature of
      sugary drinks contributes to unhealthy weight gain and increases the
      likelihood of developing obesity-related conditions such as diabetes.
